## About:

That's project was inspired by this clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdxMkQhq58g&t=33s on YouTube where an interviewer mistakes actor Samuel L Jackson for fellow actor Laurence Fishburne. "I'M NOT LAURENCE FISHBURNE" says Samuel L Jackson wagging his finger in frustration at the clearly embarrassed reporter. As I cringed in second-hand embarrassment, it hit me … maybe I could train a neural network to do a better job at discerning between these two actors. And that's exactly what I did.

In this project I build an image classifer from scratch by :

1. Building a webscraper to aquire data
2. Clean and prepare the data using keras
3. Compile and train the model
